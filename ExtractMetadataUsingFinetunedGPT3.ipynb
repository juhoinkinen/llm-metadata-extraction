    "# Extract metadata from PDF files using fine-tuned GPT3 language model\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate how we can extract Dublin Core style metadata about PDF documents, in this case doctoral theses from four Finnish universities (Åbo Akademi, University of Turku, University of Vaasa and Lappeenranta University of Technology), using only the raw text from the first few pages of the PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of 192 documents will be split into two subsets (train: 149, test: 43). We will extract the text from around 5 pages of text, aiming for 500 to 700 words. The corresponding metadata, which has been exported from DSpace repositories of the universities, is represented in a simple textual \"key: value\" format, which should be easy enough for a language model to handle. The train set is used to create a data set which will then be used to fine-tune a GPT model. Subsequently the model can be used to generate similar metadata for unseen documents from the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this experiment, an OpenAI API access key is required. It can be generated after registering an user account (the same account can be used for e.g. ChatGPT). The API key has to be stored in an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` before starting this notebook. The finetuning will cost around \\\\$5 USD and generating new metadata with the API also has a small cost, but currently every account gets a free \\\\$18 credit from OpenAI which is plenty for this experiment even with a few iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook depends on a few Python libraries, which are listed in `requirements.txt`. See the README for details."
